# ShopLite RFC

## 1. Overview
This RFC outlines AI-related enhancements for ShopLite, a lightweight e-commerce platform. 
It focuses on two selected AI touchpoints, latency and cost targets, and integration feasibility. 
Broader non-AI system details are outside the scope of this document.

## 2. AI Touchpoints
To enhance user experience and reduce support load, ShopLite is integrating AI into:
- Semantic Typeahead search
- Multilingual Support Assistant

These were chosen for high impact and low integration risk.
